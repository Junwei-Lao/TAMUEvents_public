# Project Description:
This website uses AI (ChatGPT for now, but it may change in the future) to access the school event website (https://ers.tamu.edu/), providing a comprehensive view of what events are coming soon. 

The API key in index.js is replaced by a string "APIkey" for security reasons.

This project was built by using: 
    Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    Backend: NodeJS

The functional website is deployed on AWS EC2, here is the link: http://3.82.113.137/ 

# Why This Website:
As I noticed, many events are published only on school websites, so people often miss the events they are interested in. This project tends to collect all the published events from the school websites (only one for now, I will add more and refine the code in the future) so that people can know what kind of events are coming soon and will not miss those they are interested in.

# Some comments
This project was built completely from scratch, it took me huge efforts to learn and summarize all the information. Somehow a lot of tutorials want you to use different kinds of packages, which is not a good starting way for me to learn the fundamental operations of web development as a web developer beginner.

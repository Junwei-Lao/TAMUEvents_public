# Project Description:
This website uses AI (ChatGPT for now, but this may change in the future) to access the school event website (https://ers.tamu.edu/), which provides a comprehensive view of upcoming events. 

The API key in index.js is replaced by a string "APIkey" for security reasons.

This project was built by using: 
    Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    Backend: NodeJS

The functional website is deployed on AWS EC2, here is the link: http://3.82.113.137/ 

# Why This Website:
As I noticed, many events are published only on school websites without informing people, so we often miss the events we are interested in. This project tends to collect all the published events from the school websites (only one website for now, but I will add more and refine the code in the future) so that people can know what kind of events are coming soon and will not miss those they feel interesting.

# Some comments
This project was built completely from scratch. It took me a huge effort to learn all the concepts and summarize the information. A lot of tutorials want you to use different kinds of packages, but for me, that is not a good starting point to understand the fundamental operations of web development as a web developer beginner.
